# Uber-Fare-Price-Prediction

This project explored the factors on which the price of fare depends and built a model to predict the future fare price accurately

Problem Statement:- The project is about world's largest taxi company Uber inc. In these project we're looking to predict the fare for their future transactional cases. And this company deliever services to lakhs of customers daily. Now it becomes really important to manage their data properly to come up with new business ideas to get best results. So, it becomes really important to estimate the fare prices accurately.

Operations involved in this project are as follows: 1. Data Exploration
                                                    2. Feature Engineering
                                                    3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
                                                    4. Data Pre-processing
                                                    5. Data Manipulation
                                                    6. Predictive Modelling
